## Project Description

InstaDiary is an application that provides a great medium for travelers to documents thier trips from local areas to countries abroad. Users of the application are able to visually log thier trips on Google Maps for others to see. With each location logged on the application, users are able to upload photos and provide a brief blog post about thier trip. InstaDiary can be used to view other users travel itinerary & experience to make your future travel plans more efficiently.
